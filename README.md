 Project discription:

 1) Project "Around The U.S." â€” an interactive page where users can add, remove, or like photos.

 2) Technology that I used:
 - grid and flex layouts
 - media query for breakpoints
 - BEM naming and file structure
 - block overflow
 - forms
 - Java Script 
 - popup box open and close
 
 3) In this project, I encountered the complexity of the pop-up window and its structure. In the future, I would like to understand better with the Java script.
